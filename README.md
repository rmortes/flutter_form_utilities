# Flutter Form Utilities
Form utilities that should be included by Flutter by default

## Why does this project exists?
Writting the same validators each and every time is quite cumbersome. This project is one of my
personal boilerplateless libraries, to make my life easier.

As such, this library is intended for my use exclusively, hence why I'm not publishing it to pub.dev

If you want to use this library, you can import it like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  form_utilities:
    git: https://github.com/rmortes/flutter_form_utilities.git
```
